# lab8

Problem1

Because there is a "throw;", in front of "cout << "I love C++" << endl;", 
when the program is executed to "throw", it would skip the code behind, and try to find the "catch"

Problem2

Yes, it would  show “I love C++”.
Because there is a match "catch" to catch the float, so the function would execute the code behind.
